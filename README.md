##SMART VIDEO RENAMER


**SmartVideoRenamer** is a Python-based application that automates the tedious task of organizing and renaming videos based on visual similarity to reference images. It uses the **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** to find the closest matching image for each videoâ€™s first frame and renames the video accordingly.

This tool is perfect for content creators, editors, and anyone working with large video libraries who wants to streamline organization.
